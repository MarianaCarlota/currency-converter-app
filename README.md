# Currency converter

A currency converter app that allows users to easily convert values between multiple currencies using real-time exchange rates fetched from the Uphold API. The landing page features an input field where users can enter a value to convert, and below the input, the app displays the corresponding exchange rates to various other currencies. Additionally, users can select the base currency from which the conversion will occur.
